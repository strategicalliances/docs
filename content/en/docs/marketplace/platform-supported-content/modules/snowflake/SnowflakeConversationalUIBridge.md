## Introduction

The [Snowflake ConversationalUI Bridge Module](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/225717) Helps one implement Conversational UI for Snowflake Cortex Analyst.

### Typical Use Cases

When using the Snowflake AI Data Connector and want to implement Conversational UI for Snowflake Cortex Analyst one can use the SnowflakeConversational UI Bridge module to easily implement Conversational UI for Cortex Analyst.

* Authentication:

    * Authentication with an RSA key pair according to PKCS #8 standard
    * Authentication with OAUTH through an OIDC provider or PAT -> You will need to add your OAuth token or PAT and optionally its expiration date to the BearerToken created in the "ChatCompletions_CallLLM" microflow. 

* Functionality: Easily implement chat interfaces for Cortex Analyst using Conversational UI:

    * Test page "SnowflakeConfig_TestingPage" for the different chat interfaces provided by conversational UI. Acts a a quick testing page and an Example of how one could set up a chat interface for Cortex Analyst using ConversationalUI. Simply add the page to your project navigation and start exploring.
    * EchoDeployedModel overview page "EchoDeployedModel_Overview". Used to configure your Contex Analyst implementations by creating EchoDeployedModels. Needs SnowflakeAIDataConnector.ConnectionDetails object.
    * Snippet for ChatHistory bar 'Snippet_ChatContext_ChatHistoryBar'. Needs ConversationalUI.ChatContext object.
    * Snippet for Cortex Analyst Model configuration page 'Snippet_ModelConfig'. Needs ConversationalUI.ChatContext object.
    * Example page "FullScreenChat_HistoryAndProviderSelection" for full screen chat with history bar and provider selection.
    * Action Microflow: 'ChatCompletions_CallLLM' for the "EchoDeployedModel" which is set in 'EchoDeployedModel_Create'. Handels calls to Cortex Analyst and maps GenAICommons request to Cortex Analyst request and Cortex Analyst response to GenAICommons response.
    * Action Microflow: 'ChatContext_ChatWithHistory_ActionMicroflow' for the "SnowflakeConversationalUIConfig" which is set in 'SnowflakeConversationalUIConfig_GetCreate'. Does some pre and post processing creating Conversational UI Messages, References, etc.
